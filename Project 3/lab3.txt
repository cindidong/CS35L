This warning occurred because I never indicated the signature 
belongs to the owner.

2. Commands:
mkdir tempCoreUtils (temp directory)
cd coreutils-8.29
emacs INSTALL (looked up how to install properly)
(need to use configure command with absolute path)
./configure --prefix=/u/be/ugrad/cindi/tempCoreUtils
make
make install

3. Commands:
(testing the /usr/bin ls)
/usr/bin/ls -a -A
/usr/bin/ls -a -A
(testing the coreutils ls)
cd tempCoreUtils/bin
./ls -a -A
./ls -A -a
For both of them, -a overrides -A

4. Commands:
cd ~/coreutils-8.29
emacs patch_file (pasted the patch diff file into this file)
patch -p1 < patch_file

5. Commands:
make (to compile)

6. Commands:
cd src
./ls -a -A (the . and .. were not printed)
./ls -A -a (the . and .. were printed)

Question 1. In the case 'A', the patch removed the if statement 
{if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)}, 
leaving only the body of the if statement. 
Since the program no longer has to check the value of ignore_mode, 
the program is faster.

Question 2. They should watch out for any cases where the order 
of -a and -A mattered. For example, any programs that used the fact 
that -a would always override -A would now have unintended results, 
since now -A will override -a.

See hw3.txt for questions 3-5.
